# Text Extractor

In a workshop with fact checkers, we discovered that the text in images/memes is often the primary focus in debunking efforts. Fact checkers typically type out the text the see in images to search it on Google. We realized that the [Googleâ€™s Cloud Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/) can automate this process. This service is an interface to interact with the API more easily.
